I've fixed the issue by removing the additional fields that were appearing when "Yes" was selected for "HAR file attached".
The problem was that we had added two placeholder fields in the template configuration:
harFileUploader - This was showing up as "HAR File Upload" text field
harPlaceholder - This was showing up as "undefined" text field
These fields aren't actually needed because the real HAR file upload UI is created dynamically by the setupHarFileUploader function in dynamic-tracker.html. The fields were intended to be placeholders but were instead causing additional text inputs to appear in the form.
The fix removes these unnecessary fields from the template configuration while keeping all the actual functionality intact. When you select "Yes" for HAR file attached, you'll now only see the proper file upload button without any additional text fields.
