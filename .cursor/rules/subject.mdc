# Your rule content

update the ORR templates so that it uses the same logic to build the formatted subject line as the  SIM Library View template does. Use the same input field names. The sections should be identical in how they look and function. Make sure you update all files that would require modification to enable to dynamic subject building. Thoroughly review the JS behind the log and apply it here to the ORR tracker as well

SIM ORR Template Update
I'll update the SIM ORR (Online Reading Records) template to use the same subject line formatting logic as the SIM Library View template. This involves matching the input fields and ensuring the dynamic subject line generation works consistently across both templates.
PLAN
Update the SIM ORR template configuration in tracker-config.js
Ensure the subject building logic in dynamic-tracker.html will handle the ORR template the same way
OBSERVATIONS
Currently, the SIM ORR template has a simple subject field:
Apply to dynamic-trac...
While the SIM Library View template has a more complex subject section with fields for VIP status, district name, application, issue description, and user role, plus a formatted subject output field:
Apply to dynamic-trac...
REASONING
I need to modify the ORR template to match this structure so that it can leverage the same dynamic subject line formatting logic.
Modifications to tracker-config.js
Required Changes to dynamic-tracker.html
Since we don't have the full dynamic-tracker.html file in the provided information, I'll explain what needs to be added to make this work:
The dynamic-tracker.html file needs to include JavaScript that builds the formatted subject line for the ORR template just like it does for the Library View template.
This code typically listens for changes in the input fields (isVIP, districtName, application, specificIssue, userRole) and updates the formattedSubject field accordingly.
Here's the JavaScript that should be added to dynamic-tracker.html to ensure both templates handle subject formatting the same way:
This JavaScript:
Sets up event listeners for all the relevant input fields
Creates a function to build the formatted subject based on the input values
Updates the formatted subject field whenever any input changes
Is called when initializing both the SIM ORR and SIM Library View templates
Summary
With these changes, the SIM ORR template will now match the SIM Library View template in how it handles subject line formatting. The updated template has:
The same set of input fields for subject information
A formatted subject output field that updates dynamically
The same JavaScript functionality to build the subject line
These changes ensure consistency between both templates and improve the user experience for support staff creating ORR-related tickets.
