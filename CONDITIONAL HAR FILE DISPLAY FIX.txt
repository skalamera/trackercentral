The problem is that the sim-orr template is not included in the condition check in the setupHarFileUploader method. Let me update both the setupCustomFileUploaders and setupHarFileUploader methods to include the sim-orr template:

dynamic-tracker.html:
// Add a method to set up the HAR file uploader
            setupHarFileUploader() {
                // Apply to sim-assignment, sim-assessment-reports, sim-library-view, sim-fsa, and sim-orr templates
                if (this.trackerType !== 'sim-assignment' &&
                    this.trackerType !== 'sim-assessment-reports' &&
                    this.trackerType !== 'sim-library-view' &&
                    this.trackerType !== 'sim-fsa' &&
                    this.trackerType !== 'sim-orr') {
                    return;
                }

                // Find the HAR file attached dropdown
                const harFileAttached = document.getElementById('harFileAttached');
                if (!harFileAttached) {
                    console.warn('HAR file attached dropdown not found');
                    return;
                }

Now let's also update the addAttachmentsAsNote method to include the sim-orr template, so HAR files can be properly uploaded:

dynamic-tracker.html:
// Replace the addAttachmentsAsNote method with this version that uses a single note
            async addAttachmentsAsNote(ticketId) {
                const hasScreenshots = this.aggregatedScreenshotFiles && this.aggregatedScreenshotFiles.length > 0;
                const hasHarFile = (this.trackerType === 'sim-assignment' ||
                    this.trackerType === 'sim-assessment-reports' ||
                    this.trackerType === 'sim-fsa' ||
                    this.trackerType === 'sim-library-view' ||
                    this.trackerType === 'sim-orr') &&
                    this.harFile;

The HAR file uploader for the SIM ORR template should now work correctly. I've made two important changes:

1. Updated the setupHarFileUploader method to include the 'sim-orr' template in the condition 

2. check, so the HAR file uploader will be properly initialized for the SIM ORR template
Updated the addAttachmentsAsNote method to include the 'sim-orr' template in the HAR file condition, ensuring HAR files will be properly uploaded when a tracker ticket is created

These changes will allow the HAR file uploader to display correctly when "HAR file attached" is set to "Yes" in the SIM ORR template, just like it does in the other SIM templates. Instead of showing a text field, it will now show a proper file upload button with the necessary styling and functionality to attach HAR files to the ticket.
