# Freshdesk Custom App - Tracker Central Documentation

## Overview

Tracker Central is a robust Freshdesk Custom App that integrates directly into the sidebar of every ticket, improving agent workflow and issue tracking abilities. The application provides clear visibility of ticket connections by showing all associations grouped by company (district), with unique company count indicators that help agents quickly understand issue impact across different districts.

When initiating a tracker, agents access a purpose-built creation interface featuring specialized templates tailored for various issue types. These templates are displayed in a modal and include dynamic forms that gather relevant information while maintaining documentation consistency. The system properly connects trackers to source tickets and maintains important metadata throughout.

By collecting data through standardized template forms and automating the population of critical fields, Tracker Central ensures data consistency across all trackers. This standardization significantly enhances reporting capabilities, enabling management to generate accurate analytics on issue patterns, resolution metrics, and district-specific impacts. The streamlined workflow reduces manual data entry requirements, eliminating potential human error, and allowing agents to dedicate more time to resolution activities rather than administrative tasks, while simultaneously providing reliable data.
