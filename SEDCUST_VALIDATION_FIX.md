# SEDCUST Template Validation Fix

## Problem Description

Some agents were experiencing validation failures when creating SEDCUST template trackers, with console errors:
- `Error creating ticket: dynamic-tracker.html?type=sedcust:5957`
- `Detailed API error response : dynamic-tracker.html?type=sedcust:5963`
- `API Error 1: dynamic-tracker.html?type=sedcust:5967`
- `Failed to create ticket: Validation failed`

## Root Cause Analysis

The validation failures were caused by several potential issues:

1. **Missing Required Fields**: The SEDCUST template requires these fields:
   - `xcode`, `application`, `resource`, `path`, `specificIssue`, `districtName`, `districtState`

2. **District State Conditional Validation**: The `districtState` field is conditionally required - it's only required when `districtName` is NOT "Benchmark Education Company"

3. **Asynchronous Field Population**: The `populateDistrictState()` function is asynchronous and may not complete before form submission

4. **Missing Email Field**: The email field is required for ticket creation but may not be properly populated

5. **Related Tickets Field**: This field is required but may be empty

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Enhanced Validation Function (`sedcust.js`)

Added `window.validateSedcustFields()` function that:
- Checks each required field individually
- Provides detailed logging for debugging
- Handles the conditional validation for `districtState`
- Checks for email and related tickets fields
- Returns specific error messages for missing fields

### 2. Pre-Submit Validation Hook (`sedcust.js`)

Added an event listener to the submit button that:
- Runs enhanced validation before form submission
- Prevents submission if validation fails
- Shows detailed error messages to users
- Uses capture phase to run before other handlers

### 3. Improved Error Handling (`dynamic-tracker.js`)

Enhanced the `createTicket` method to:
- Provide template-specific error messages
- Log detailed debugging information for SEDCUST
- Run client-side validation on API errors
- Show helpful guidance for required fields

### 4. Robust Field Population (`fieldPopulators.js`)

Improved `populateDistrictState()` to:
- Handle edge cases better
- Extract state from district name patterns
- Use fallback approaches when company data is unavailable
- Clear state field for "Benchmark Education Company"

### 5. Better Logging (`templateBase.js`)

Added logging to `shouldSkipFieldValidation()` to help debug conditional validation issues.

### 6. Email Field Population (`sedcust.js`)

Added `ensureEmailField()` function that:
- Checks if email field is populated
- Attempts to populate from logged-in user data
- Falls back to ticket data if available
- Runs multiple times to ensure population

## Debugging Steps for Agents

If you encounter validation errors with SEDCUST template:

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for "SEDCUST:" prefixed messages that show detailed validation status

2. **Verify Required Fields**: Ensure all these fields are filled:
   - Xcode
   - Program Name
   - Resource
   - Path
   - Specific Issue
   - District Name
   - District State (unless District Name is "Benchmark Education Company")
   - Related Tickets
   - Email

3. **Check District State Logic**: If District Name is "Benchmark Education Company", the District State field should be empty or will be ignored

4. **Verify Email Population**: The email field should auto-populate from your logged-in user account

5. **Check Related Tickets**: Make sure you've entered at least one valid related ticket ID

## Testing the Fix

To test if the fix is working:

1. Open a SEDCUST template tracker
2. Fill out the form with valid data
3. Check the browser console for "SEDCUST:" messages
4. Try submitting - you should see validation messages
5. If validation fails, check the specific error messages provided

## Future Improvements

Consider implementing:
- Real-time validation feedback as users type
- Better visual indicators for required fields
- Automatic retry mechanism for failed field population
- More sophisticated state extraction from district names

## Technical Notes

- The validation function is attached to `window` for global access
- Pre-submit validation uses capture phase to run first
- Error messages are now more specific and actionable
- Logging is extensive for debugging but can be reduced in production
